Description - Conference Management Software System
Requirements: 
Consider the design of the following database system for managing a particular
conference: a collection of papers are submitted to the conference, each of which has
a unique paper ID, a list of authors (names, affiliations, emails) in the order of
contribution significance, title, abstract, and a PDF file for its content. The conference
has a list of program committee (PC) members to review the papers. To ensure review
quality, each paper is assigned to 3 PC members for review. To avoid overloading,
each PC member is assigned to at most 5 papers, assuming that there are enough
PC members. Each review report consists of a report ID, a description of review
comment, a final recommendation (accept, reject), and the date the review report is
submitted. A PC member can submit at most one review report for the paper that is
assigned to him/her
